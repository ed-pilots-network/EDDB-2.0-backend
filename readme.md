# Elite Dangerous Pilot Network Backend (EDPN Backend)
The Elite Dangerous Pilot Network Backend (EDPN Backend) project provides a REST API that consumes data from the Elite Dangerous Data Network (EDDN) message stream. The data is then processed and stored in a database for use by other applications.

## Technologies Used
The EDPN Backend project is built using the following technologies:

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): An open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications quickly and easily.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): A build automation tool used to manage dependencies and build Java projects.
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/): A distributed streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/): An open-source relational database management system used to store data for the EDPN Backend project.
- [MyBatis](https://mybatis.org/): A persistence framework that simplifies the development of Java applications working with relational databases.
- [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/): An open-source database schema migration tool used to track, manage, and apply database changes.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): A platform used to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

## Project Structure
The EDPN Backend project consists of several independent modules which are then used by the `boot` module to server them to the end user:

### Code structure
The projects follow a hexagonal architecture pattern and adheres to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

#### Application Layer

The application layer contains the following components:

- **controller**: This package contains the REST controllers, which handle incoming HTTP requests and provide appropriate responses.
- **dto**: This package contains the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used for communication between the application layer and external clients.
- **mapper**: This package contains mappers responsible for converting between DTO and domain model.
- **usecase**: This package contains the implementations of the use cases defined in the domain.

#### Configuration Layer

The config layer contains all the Bean configurations and annotations needed to instantiate the beans and bootstrap the Spring boot application

### Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the following components:

- **model**: This package contains the domain models (entities and value objects) that represent the core concepts of the problem domain.
- **repository**: This package contains the repository interfaces that define the contract for persisting and retrieving domain models.

### Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer contains the following components:

- **kafka**: this package contains the processors for the kafka messages

- **persistence**:
  - **entity**: This package contains the entity objects used for storing the data in the database.
  - **mappers**: 
    - **entity**: This package contains mapper classes for convert between domain and entity objects.
    - **mybatis**: This package contains the mybatis mappers to interface with the database.
  - **repository**: This package contains the database specific repository implementations.

## Data flow
The EDPN Backend project, follow the following data flow:

1. The `eddn-message-listener` project to consumes the EDDN message stream and store it in a Kafka
2. The message processor projects consume and process the data from the Kafka stream and store it in a Postgres database
3. The REST APIs access the Postgres database to serve the data

___
## Installation
To install and run the EDPN Backend project, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker
2. install Docker-compose
3. run the following command from the root project folder: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`. This command will:
   - create a stack which contains a Zookeeper, a Kafka, and a postgres
   - pull and run initialize the `eddn-message-listener` container
   - containerize the code via the dockerfile included, and run it in the stack

___
## Local Development
to run the stack for local development, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker
2. install Docker-compose
3. run the following command from the root project folder: `docker compose -f docker-compose-localdev.yml up -d`. This command will:
    - create a stack which contains a Zookeeper, a Kafka, and a postgres with the needed ports exposed on localhost
4. You can now run/debug the project main class (`io.edpn.backend.EDPNApplication` in boot project) with spring profile `local`

**keep in mind that the EddnMessageListener application needs to be run separately to receive messages to process**

in short: docker compose up the stack, run both of the projects from IDE

---
## Deploying
Note to Ops, you need the following files/folders from the repository:

- docker-compose.yml
- .env
- env/dev (if deploying to a hosted dev environment)

Save the files, using the existing folder structure from this repository, starting at `/opt/edpn-backend` - set file permissions appropriately (ops group, and 660 on files). Next, edit the `.env` file, setting `ENVIRONMENT=dev`. 

Finally, in that directory, `docker compose up`. Everything should come up and show healthy within a few minutes.

In future, we should automate this via pipeline, etc.

## Further info
### MyBatis
MyBatis is a popular persistence framework that offers support for custom SQL, stored procedures, and advanced mappings. We chose MyBatis over JPA for this project due to its flexibility in handling complex database operations.

#### Annotation-based Configuration
In our project, MyBatis configuration is achieved entirely through annotations. Mappers are marked with the `@Mapper` annotation, and queries are specified within the interfaces using annotations. For more details on the bean configuration, refer to the `io.edpn.backend.trade.cnfiguration.MyBatisConfiguration` class for an example.

### Liquibase
Liquibase is a powerful open-source, database-independent library used for tracking, managing, and applying database schema changes. In this project, Liquibase is responsible for handling database migrations and changes.

#### XML-based Configuration

Liquibase's configuration is defined in XML format. The master file, `src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml`, contains a list of changeSets that need to be applied in a specific order. Each changeSet is an individual XML file that specifies the database changes to be executed.

For every changeSet, a unique ID and an author must be provided. The unique ID is a UUID, and the author should be your GitHub username. This information helps track the history of database schema changes and the responsible contributors.

For more information on MyBatis and Liquibase, refer to their official documentation:

- [MyBatis Documentation](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/index.html)
- [Liquibase Documentation](https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html)
